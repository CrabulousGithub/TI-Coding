I use this for code, I have this public so you can read the code and maybe it will help you figure out coding on TI for yourself! I will mark all files on here with these codes, which show what model they are designed for.

CE- TI-84 Plus CE
NS- Nspire CX
84- TI-84 Plus SE
89- TI-89

HOW TO COMPILE:
1. Get TI Connect CE. Make sure it is CE, as the other Connect program does not support writing code. Get TI Connect CE here; https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware
2. Once you have set up the program, open it, and click on the 3 square icon on the left bar.
3. Create a new program, set the name, and copy and paste the code in. 
4. Click the save icon, and it should be exported.
